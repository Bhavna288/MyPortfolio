                    <p>I am a third-year Computer Engineering student based in Nadiad. I write code and create websites. My areas of interest are MERN stack, machine learning, and cloud computing. I can multitask, adapt to new development environments, learn new technologies, create reliable code and find creative solutions to perplexing problems.</p>

                    <p>I started making a website as a part of the assignment, but now it is my passion. My first website was about an e-menu for the restaurant, for which I used basic front-end and PHP and MySQL in the backend. The front-end was too simple and not interactive enough to make my site stand out. That is when I started learning JavaScript. When I created my next website using simple JS for both the front-end and the backend, the code got too long and repetitive. This made me understand the importance of a framework. After reading numerous articles about the best framework for JavaScript on the internet, I chose ReactJS. At first, I found it difficult to learn without being taught at college, but I got all my errors solved through StackOverflow. Eventually, I felt confident enough to focus on the MERN stack and created an event-organizing website as a part of the group project. Thereupon I realized I wanted to work more in it. I worked as a lead full-stack web developer for the event CDEC organized at my university where I developed the website with my peers.</p>

                    <p>Eight months ago, I applied for the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador(MSLA) program and got selected. MSLA is a global community of college students, who learn and organize events. From the benefits I got through this program, I explored Microsoft Azure and organized a webinar-cum-workshop about Azure Cognitive Services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I developed an interest in machine learning and applied some of the services of Azure related to it in my projects. I created a website for text extraction from an image using Computer vision and another website for skin cancer detection and hosted it on Azure.</p>
